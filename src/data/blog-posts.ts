    title: "7 Ways To Improve Website Usability And Accessibility",
    category: "E-Commerce Marvels",
    excerpt:
      "Creating websites that work for everyone isn't just good ethics—it's good business. Learn practical strategies to improve usability and accessibility.",
    content: `Creating websites that work for everyone isn't just good ethics—it's good business. Accessible, usable websites reach broader audiences, improve SEO, and create better experiences for all users. Here are seven practical strategies to improve your site.

## 1. Prioritize Clear Navigation

Users should understand where they are and how to get where they want to go. Implement:

- **Consistent navigation placement** across all pages
- **Descriptive menu labels** that clearly indicate content
- **Breadcrumb trails** for complex site structures
- **Skip navigation links** for keyboard users

## 2. Ensure Sufficient Color Contrast

Text must be readable against its background. WCAG guidelines recommend:

- **4.5:1 contrast ratio** for normal text
- **3:1 contrast ratio** for large text
- **Use contrast checking tools** to verify compliance
- **Don't rely solely on color** to convey information

## 3. Write Descriptive Alt Text

Screen reader users depend on alt text to understand images. Best practices:

- **Describe the image's purpose**, not just its appearance
- **Keep it concise** but informative
- **Mark decorative images** with empty alt attributes
- **Include text in images** within alt descriptions

## 4. Design for Keyboard Navigation

Many users navigate without a mouse. Ensure:

- **All interactive elements** are keyboard accessible
- **Focus states** are clearly visible
- **Tab order** follows logical content flow
- **Focus traps** are avoided or clearly marked

## 5. Use Semantic HTML

Proper HTML structure helps assistive technologies interpret content:

- **Use heading hierarchy** (H1 → H2 → H3) correctly
- **Mark up lists** with appropriate list elements
- **Use landmark roles** (header, main, footer)
- **Label form elements** explicitly

## 6. Optimize for Mobile Users

Mobile-first design benefits everyone:

- **Touch targets** should be at least 44x44 pixels
- **Forms** should use appropriate input types
- **Content** should reflow without horizontal scrolling
- **Font sizes** should remain readable without zooming

## 7. Test with Real Users

Automated tools catch many issues, but human testing is essential:

- **Include users with disabilities** in testing
- **Test with actual assistive technologies**
- **Observe real-world usage patterns**
- **Iterate based on feedback**

## The Business Case

Accessibility improvements deliver measurable benefits:

- **Expanded market reach** to users with disabilities
- **Improved SEO** from semantic markup
- **Better mobile experience** for all users
- **Reduced legal risk** from compliance

## Getting Started

Don't try to fix everything at once. Instead:

1. **Audit your current state** using automated tools
2. **Prioritize high-impact issues** affecting the most users
3. **Build accessibility into your workflow** rather than retrofitting
4. **Train your team** on accessibility principles

Creating accessible websites is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time project. Start where you are, make consistent progress, and remember that every improvement helps real people access your content.`,
